Programming Assignment 1:  Percolation


/******************************************************************************
 *  Describe whatever help, if any, that you received on this assignment.
 *    - Include help from individuals, including course staff, lab TAs,
 *      classmates, friends, and external sources. Attribute them by
 *      name; specify the nature of the help; and include the date(s)
 *      on which you received help.
 *    - Do not include course materials (such as the lectures, precepts,
 *      booksite, textbook, and Ed Discussion).
 *    - Write "none" if you did not receive any help.
 *
 *  Here is an example:
 *
 *      9/10/24 Grace Hopper (lab TA)
 *      Helped me fix a bug in my code that mapped from 2D coordinates
 *      to 1D coordinates.
 *
 *      9/12/24 John von Neumann (classmate)
 *      Helped me understand the meaning of "backwash" and why my code
 *      was failing the backwash tests.

9/4/25 Jiatong Yu (Preceptor - Office Hours)
Helped me fix a bug that checked whether neighboring (left/right/up/down) sites
were open. Helped me with using the term of "virtual" top or bottom, which was
referred to as additional top or bottom in my Percolation program.

9/5/25 Mingkun Zhao (Preceptor - Office Hours)
Helped clarify that the stopwatch implementation should record the average number
of seconds that it takes for a trial to percolate.

9/5/25 Spencer (Intro COS Lab TA)
Helped search for bugs based on the TigerFile feedback. Helped me understand
that the instance variables from Percolation should be private, not public
because I should access those values using other methods already available in
Percolate. Also, Spencer helped me realize that many of the failed cases were a
result from not throwing an IllegalArgumentException when needed. Spencer
explained why declaring a Percolation object as an instance variable is not as
good as making it a local variable, same thing for the Stopwatch object.
